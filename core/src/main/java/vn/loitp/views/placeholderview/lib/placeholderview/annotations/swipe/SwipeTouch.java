/**
 * This has to be used on method with four float members variables.
 * xStart, yStart, xCurrent, yCurrent
 * xStart: It is the initial touch location x co-ordinate
 * yStart: It is the initial touch location y co-ordinate
 * xCurrent: It is the current touch location x co-ordinate
 * yCurrent: It is the current touch location x co-ordinate
 * distance moved can be calculated as: sqrt(sq(xCurrent - xStart) + sq(yCurrent - yStart))
 * : Example : @SwipeTouch private void onSwipeTouch(
 * float xStart, float yStart, float xCurrent, float yCurrent){//something here}
 * This works only with SwipeDirectionalView
